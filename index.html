 AND THUS THE JOURNEY BEGAN

 As the years go by and the computernet evolves at supersonic speeds, there has been many stones left unturned and too little time or maturity on my part to have made something out of them all. Writing an online journal is one of them and I just found the perfect excuse to do so.

So what is this then? Well for the most part, a weekly kick in the butt to help me in my 'quest into adulthood' (title of my sextape) maybe preventing me of crashing into Mylifethisendlesscrevasse mountain again. For you, well.. I trust you'll make up your own mind about that.

A depressing one liner background about myself? Well sure here ya go:

Information-communication studies, travel to South America, first short film, music videos, other video projects, painting, aborted documentary film, second aborted documentary film, Python programming, first game jam, more Python programming, hardware self training, cryptography self training, network security self hacking, application to the 42 code school, infosec certifications training, online journal because I'm incapable of standing in place whilst waiting for the entry exam to start (and my life to unravel).

Anyway you get it, I'm searching for my spirit animal and this is the death letter to my young self, also I'll do some programming so there'll be some of that.

Cheers
